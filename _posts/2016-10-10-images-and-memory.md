## The family album



## The purpose of a photo

"Telling stories about the past, our past, is a key moment in the making of our selves. To the extent that memory provides the raw material, such narratives of identiy are shaped as much by what is left out of the account -- whether forgotten or repressed -- as by what is actually told."

"A coherent story not only absorbs the listener -- but being a moment in the production of self -- satisfies the storyteller as well."

## The problem with digital photos

"Photographs now are accumulations rather than collections" Seabrook 184

Today, software universally presents photos in a time-linear grid, a kind of virtual shoebox full of prints. However, our oral reportage of events is not simply an unfiltered timeline of facts, but an evaluation of those facts.8 Creating narratives from experiences is a critical part of personality building, increases life satisfaction, communicates current events, and spreads empathy.9,10 Itâ€™s time that photo management tools were built for storytelling, not card-cataloging.

"We should still continue as family and social archivists and historians to produce albums about our everyday lives -- even if we are not sure what to do with them at the moment."


## Reflection and manipulation

"The 'naive' conventions of the 'private' snapshot, deeply embedded through participatory usage, are drawn on by 'public' modes -- which unlike the snapshot aim to be understood by as wide an audience as possible."

In 2016, Apple released a new "Memories" feature for iOS 10. There are parts of this that I really like! However, there are some parts that I do not. Take a look at the introduction, embedded below.

The way that Apple uses music here is not unique to Apple. Facebook, Google, and GoPro all apply or suggest the application of emotionally manipulative music to user videos.

### Easy vs. hard

Avoiding misguessed emotion is easy, but misses opportunities. Guessing emotion is hard, dangerous even.
