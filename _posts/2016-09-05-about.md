title: About Vignette
---

Vignette is an open source project investigating new ways of encouraging narrative creation from personal media. Vignette will be exploring data-driven methods for managing large quantities of photos and videos, visualizations that highlight the importance of place in narrative, and interfaces that engage users conversationally and emotionally.

In addition to releasing source code and final products, it is the intent of Vignette to develop and discuss as transparently as possible. To this end, the [development blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog) provides updates on current research and prototypes.
